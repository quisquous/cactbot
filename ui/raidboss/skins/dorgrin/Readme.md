# Dorgrin's Raidboss Customisations

Some customisations I mate to make raidboss a bit nicer on my eyes. Changes include colours, font face, bar and alert sizes.

Warnings are larger and have a translucent background to make them more easily noticable. Timelines are taller, wider, and brighter.

A custom font is used, which is optional. See below for installation instructions and source.
