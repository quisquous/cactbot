# Dorgrin's Raidboss Customisations

Some customisations I mate to make raidboss a bit nicer on my eyes. Changes include colours, font face, bar and alert sizes.

Warnings are larger and have a translucent background to make them more easily noticable. Timelines are taller, wider, and brighter.

A custom font is used, which is optional. See below for installation instructions and source.

## Peace Sans Font Installation

If you'd like to use the custom font, just follow these instructions. The stylesheet tries to use it; if it's not available, it'll fallback to default.

1. Go to [https://www.dafont.com/peace_sans.font](https://www.dafont.com/peace_sans.font)
2. Press `Download`
3. Open the zip file
4. Double click on `Peace Sans.otf`
5. Press `Install` at the top of your screen
6. If ACT is already running, reload the overlay to see the changes. Otherwise, you're done!
