// Example trigger.
//
// Fields that can be a function will receive the following arguments:
// data: An object that triggers may store state on. It is reset when combat ends.
//       It comes with the following fields pre-set:
//         me: The player's character name.
//         job: The player's job.
//         role: The role of the player's job (tank/healer/dps/crafter/gatherer).
//         lang: The current language, e.g. 'en', 'fr', 'ko', 'de', 'ja'.
//         currentHP: The player's current HP (may be slightly delayed)
//         function ShortName(name): A function that simplifies a player's name into something shorter, usually first name.
//         function StopCombat(): Manually stop timelines and triggers, usually paired with resetWhenOutOfCombat = false.
// matches: The regex match result of the trigger's regex to the log line it matched.
//          matches[0] will be the entire match, and matches[1] will be the first group
//          in the regex, etc. This can be used to pull data out of the log line.
//         function canFeint()/canSleep()/canStun()/canSilence()/canAddle(): if the player can do these abilities
//

  delaySeconds: 0,
  // Time to wait in seconds before showing this trigger again.  May be a number of a function(data, matches).  The time to wait begins at the regex (and not after the delaySeconds).  These triggers will not run anything.  This can be used for catching the first of many events if there's log spam.

  // true, nothing is shown/sounded/run. This is the first thing that is run on the trigger.
  condition: function(data, matches) { return true if it should run }
  // A function(data, matches) to run. This runs as the first step after condition.
  preRun: function(data, matches) { do stuff.. },
  // A function(data, matches) to run. This runs as the last step when the trigger fires.

Any field that can return a function (e.g. infoText, alertText, alarmText, tts) can also return a localized
object, e.g. instead of returning 'Get Out', they can return {en: 'Get Out', fr: 'something french'}
instead.  Fields can also return a function that return a localized object as well.  If the current locale
does not exist in the object, the 'en' result will be returned.


The full order of evaluation of functions in a trigger is:
1. condition
2. preRun
3. delaySeconds
4. durationSeconds
5. suppressSeconds
6. infoText
7. alertText
8. alarmText
9. tts
10. run
