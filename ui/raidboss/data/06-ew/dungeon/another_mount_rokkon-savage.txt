# Note: for Stormcloud Summons, differing amounts of Smokeater create different timings
# and ability ids for both the "circles" and "lines" patterns. The timelines match up
# after that, and the timings from a timeline are not that useful, so these are mostly
# skipped. Triggers will probably do a better job for the "circles" case, while "lines"
# is just a dodge check.
