# I am but a wee little test timeline
#
# Teleport your way to Summerford Farms, ancestral home of striking dummies.
#
# Make sure emotes show up in your log, such that /bow generates a line such
# as "You bow courteously to the striking dummy." Once that is turned on,
# /bow to the striking dummy to start the timeline.
#
# Alternatively, do a countdown, such as "/countdown 5" which will also
# start it.
#
# /poke, /pysch, or /laugh at the striking dummy for trigger examples.
#
# /goodbye to the striking dummy to stop the timeline.
