# Note: Use zone seal message instead of 0x104 line to start timeline

### Phase 3 (45%): allagan field
# NOTE: there seems to be two different last phase timings
# for diffusion ray, depending on when you push.
# There's the allagan field + 2 ray pattern (e.g. 380), where ray comes with missile/late
# There's the allagan field + 3 ray pattern (e.g. 420), where ray comes with field/bomb/surge
# The first 380 pattern seems always correct, however sometimes the 420 pattern
# can instead be the 380/460 pattern, with a different diffusion ray.
# The field/missile/bomb/surge timings are all roughly the same, so this
# just removes the ray syncs and hopes for the best.
