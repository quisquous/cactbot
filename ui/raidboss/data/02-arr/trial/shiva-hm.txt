# Notes:
# * no enrage (at least in twenty minutes)
# * like extreme, will go invincible if pushed below 40% until adds are dead
# * always starts out staff phase sword phase, then a random one during adds
# * the first phase after the cutscene has slightly different timings/abilities
# * during phase 1, the icicle impact between phase 2 and 3 is always cross
# * after the cutscene, the icicle impact is always the circle
# * the remaining icicle impacts are random, but it doesn't affect the timeline
# * unlike extreme, the permafrosts are guaranteed (thank goodness)
