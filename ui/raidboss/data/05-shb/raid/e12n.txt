# Paths split here. Titan OR Shiva can be used first,
# and then this first block, always ending in 5861 Release,
# is followed by:

# Unknown_5879 > Cast > Cast > Maleficium
# The time between 5861 Release and Unknown 5879
# is consistent at 9 seconds for both Shiva and Titan.

# It will then continue to the other of Titan/Shiva,
# which will in turn be followed by the other closing pattern:

# Stock > Formless Judgment > Unknown_5879 > Release
# The time between Release and Stock is consistent at 14 seconds.
