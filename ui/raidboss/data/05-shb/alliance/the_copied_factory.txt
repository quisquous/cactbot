# Alliance A floor: 4819
# Alliance B floor: 481A
# Alliance C floor: 481B

# This is a mess, so has been simplified to just "wall mechanic" and "floor mechanic".
# You can use the make_timeline parameters above to see the combined set of mechanics.

# Notes for the future:
# Alliance A's floor mechanic is "Electromagnetic Pulse" on "Floor 1" and "Floor 2"
# Alliance B's floor mechanic is a single "Unwilling Cargo" on "Floor 1"
# Alliance C's floor mechanic is "Oil Well" on "Floor 1" and "Floor 2"

# Alliance A always starts with Variable Combat Test (wall-mounted right arm)
# Alliance B always starts with Fire-Resistance Test (wall-mounted flamethrower)
# Alliance C always starts with Impact/Towerfall (wall-mounted left arm)

# Everybody will always get each of these mechanics as the first three wall mechanics,
# however, they may rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise to begin with.

# Just to make this even more worse for timelines, after the first floor mechanic
# it rotates once more, then maybe changes direction, and rotates again (???)
# It could also just be random after the floor mechanic?

# This means these options are all valid wall rotations:
# * Fire->Impact->Variable->(floor)->Variable->Impact->Fire->repeat
# * Fire->Impact->Variable->(floor)->Impact->Variable->Fire->repeat
# * Variable->Impact->Fire->(floor)->Impact->Fire->Variable->repeat

# This is why the timeline has "Wall 1 2 3" and "Wall A B C".

# TODO: you could use the initial rp text to figure out which alliance you're in,
# and then from there also use the second rp text to figure out which of the initial
# six possibilities you're in, then collapse back to three timelines, and then
# branch out to six timelines again for the second half, but it'd be, well, a lot.

# Quality Assurance will be sealed off
