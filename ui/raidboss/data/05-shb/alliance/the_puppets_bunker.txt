# Notes:
# * if one of the planes is dead, sliding swipe will end 2s earlier per dead plane
# * most abilities are done by all planes, except:
#   * Sliding Swipes done by individual planes, with unique ability ids.
#   * Incendiary Barrage (4FAF) is only done by A???
#   * Sharp Turn has unique ability ids per plane, but they all do it.
# * however, syncing against multiple planes simultaneously might cause timeline jitter
