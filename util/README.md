## Troubleshooting with SaintCoinach

### SaintCoinach FFXIV client version mismatch

When you run SaintCoinach manually, does it shows you need to update? This means that definitions are not updated to the latest patch. For minor patches, SaintCoinach does not need to update definitions, so you need to do is just change the version data to latest version.

In the SainCoinach dir open the \Definitions\game.ver file and change the version number to latest version which showed when you lauch SaintCoinach manually.
